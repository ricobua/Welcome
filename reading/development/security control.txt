access control
Permission to access a resource is called authorization.
issue ID -> ask for ID -> verify -> look up rights -> grant access
-------------
authorization
specifying access rights to resources

access requests -> access control rules
decide -> approved (granted) or disapproved (rejected)
-------------
identification -> stating a person's or thing's identity
identity document (ID) -> stating an aspects of personal identity
authentication -> confirming the truth of an attribute

credentials 
->  attestation issued by a third party (authority)
-> username & password

e.g. person 
-> provides credentials as identity document
[... or document or digital certificate]
-> system authenticates (=validates) password
-> second form of identification might be required

two-factor authentication (2FA) 
-> provides identification 
-> something you know & something you own

knowledge factors
ownership factors
inherence factors -> is or does (biometric, DNA, signature, voice)

inherence -> Anhaften, Innewohnen
-------------
roles & activities
https://lostechies.com/derickbailey/2011/05/24/dont-do-role-based-authorization-checks-do-activity-based-checks/

user -> roles
method -> activity
[simple case: method name = activity]
control system -> 
(1) roles -> activities
(2) match? -> continue

Oracle

privilege -> right to execute -> particular action -> on specific object
user -> role -> privilege

categories of privileges -> by object & attributes

System Privileges
Schema Object Privileges
Table Privileges
View Privileges
Procedure Privileges
Type Privileges

tricky:
Definer's Rights <-> Invoker's Rights
-> at the time of execution

Attributes
-> Session / Call / CPU / Logical Reads
Profile
-> collection of attributes

-------------
audit
session -> begin - end
login 
-> failed attempts
-------------
safety 
-> being protected against non-desirable events
-> "something bad will never happen"
-> security can help
-> failsafe can help
