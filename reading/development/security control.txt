safety 
-> being protected against non-desirable events
-> "something bad will never happen"

computer safety
-> "the computer is safe"
-> IT security can help
-> fail-over hardware can help

security 
-> protection against danger, damage, loss, and crime
-> level of safety

computer security (cybersecurity) -> protection 
-> of system hardware from theft or damage
-> of  software and information
-> from disruption or misdirection of service
-> from malpractice by operators
-> intentional or accidental deviation from secure procedures

stages ->
vulnerable	no
reactive	after
compliant	rules based
proactive	anticipating
resilient	adaptive
-------------
access control
Permission to access a resource is called authorization.
issue ID -> ask for ID -> verify -> 
look up rights -> grant access -> aquire resource
-------------
authorization
specifying access rights to resources

access requests -> access control rules
decide -> approved (granted) or disapproved (rejected)
-------------
identification -> stating a person's or thing's identity
identity document (ID) -> stating an aspects of personal identity

credentials 
->  attestation issued by a third party (authority)
-> I.D.
-> username & password

authentication -> confirming the truth of an attribute
e.g. person 
-> provides identity document -> credential
[... or document or digital certificate]
-> system authenticates (=validates) password
-> second form of identification might be required

two-factor authentication (2FA) 
-> provides identification 
-> something you know & something you own

knowledge factors
ownership factors
inherence factors -> is or does (biometric, DNA, signature, voice)

inherence -> Anhaften, Innewohnen
-------------
roles & activities
https://lostechies.com/derickbailey/2011/05/24/dont-do-role-based-authorization-checks-do-activity-based-checks/

user -> roles
method -> activity
[simple case: method name = activity]
control system -> 
(1) roles -> activities
(2) match? -> continue

-------------
Oracle
https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B14117_01/network.101/b10773/authoriz.htm#1009619
privilege -> right to execute -> particular action -> on specific object
user -> role -> privilege

categories of privileges -> by object & attributes

System Privileges
Schema Object Privileges
Table Privileges
View Privileges
Procedure Privileges
Type Privileges

tricky:
Definer's Rights <-> Invoker's Rights
-> at the time of execution

Attributes
-> Session / Call / CPU / Logical Reads
Profile
-> collection of attributes

-------------
audit
session -> begin - end
login 
-> failed attempts
