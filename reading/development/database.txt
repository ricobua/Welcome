tomcat -> secure jdbc password

1) tomcat NEEDS password to connect !!
2) if encrypted, tomcat needs to know how to decrypt -> code readable!!
3) read access to server.xml only to root user -> bad practice 
4) recommended solution: 
-> new user
-> minimum privileges needed to run Tomcat
-> ONLY start/stop server
-> read permissions all config files 
-> disable logging
